## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Test it! Try testing using more than one strategy. Mentally step away from the role of Software Engineer and into the role of Quality Assurance Engineer. Criticize the code like it's someone else's, not yours.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
With lots of communication. When you step away from a user interaction, verify your understanding with them before beginning the design process. Be sure to keep communication with them throughout the process and manage their expectations when needed.

## How do I approach designing software?
Design software around user needs. Try to avoid getting bogged down with "it would be nice if..." features that aren't core to the product. Plan, design, develop, test, and repeat until deployment.
